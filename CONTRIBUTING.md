Thanks for your interest in contributing data! Here's the information
I am collecting for each entry in this repository:
- number of female engineers
- number of total engineers
- data collection date

For the purposes of this project, I am counting "female engineers" as
women who are writing or architecting software, and are in full-time
roles. This generally does not include people just writing HTML/CSS
(depending on the level of sophistication of the CSS being written),
data scientists (depending on the split of work between doing analysis
and building systems and reusable code), designers, PMs, sysadmins,
etc. although the line can be blurry for people who are in mixed
roles, like engineering managers who were formerly ICs and still
contribute code -- use your judgment. Only full-time employees please; 
no interns or contractors.

To contribute numbers for a company or team, whether your own or
another, you can either

1. Send the information to me via Twitter at <a
href="https://twitter.com/triketora">@triketora</a> or message me via 
the contact form on my <a href="https://triketora.com/contact/">website</a>. 
I am happy to anonymize contributions if they are sensitive.

2. Submit a pull request amending data.txt (click this link to easily
submit a pull request:
https://github.com/triketora/women-in-software-eng/edit/master/data.txt),

    in the git commit message include:
    * the contributor (the person providing the data, preferably with
    qualifications, and a contact method such as Twitter handle) and
    * source (e.g. internal headcount, /about team page count, etc.).

    The submitter of the PR does not have to be the contributor of the data. For example:

    https://github.com/triketora/women-in-software-eng/commit/e9d76a956512247fd5f8a9a2e220a4ca403b5452
    ```
    Adding Rent the Runway.

    Contributor: Camille Fournier, VP Architecture at Rent the Runway,
        @skamille
    Source: internal headcount

    https://medium.com/grace-hopper-2013/cb997a57252#d4d8-b3d509275bf9
    Rent the Runway is 7 out of 32 if you just count dev + ops, 10 out of
    37 if you count QA, 11 out of 39 if you count all the people I manage.
    ```

    It may be helpful to add your entry somewhere besides the end of
    the list, since everyone submitting to the end of the file means
    merge conflict party.
