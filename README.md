How does the spreadsheet get updated?
-------------------------------------

Right now, I manually run `update_script.py` to pull the numbers out
of `data.txt` and submit them to the Google spreadsheet.

Something like this:

    python update_script.py -d data.txt

You can pass it in to your own spreadsheet by creating your own
project in the [Google Developers
Console](https://console.developers.google.com/), generating a client
ID for a web application with redirect URI http://localhost:8080/,
saving those credentials into `client_secrets.json`, and running the
script with your own spreadsheet key `SS_KEY` specified:

    python update_script.py -d data.txt -s $SS_KEY

Where `SS_KEY` is the key found in a Google Docs spreadsheet URL:

    https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=$SS_KEY
